# Movies-Android-Kata Part 1

Movies Android kata for practice Best Practices in Android implemented by Jorge Sánchez (Xurxodev)

Kata 1

- We are here to practice Dependency Injection.
- We are going to use [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) as Dependency Injector.
- We are going to practice pair programming.

## Considerations 

Master branch contains already solved katas, exists a branch for every kata.

## Getting started

This repository contains an Android application to show movies information:

![](/art/movies.gif)

The application initial state without dependency injection is ready to just start refactoring. 

## Tasks

Your task as Android Developer is to **refactoring to inject dependencies**, only singleton dependencies.
The recommendation for this exercise is:

  * Before starting
    1. Fork this repository and Checkout `kata-di-movies` branch or download zip.
    3. Execute the application, explore it manually and make yourself familiar with the code.

  * To help you get started:     
    1. Configure dagger 
    2. Identify singleton dependencies.
    3. Create module/s, component/s, custom application, set targets where inject dependencies
    4. Execute the app and verify that all is right
